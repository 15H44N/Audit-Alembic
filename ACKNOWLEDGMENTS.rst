Acknowledgements
================

Many thanks are of course due to `Mike Bayer <zzzeek_>`_, the author of the
amazing libraries SQLAlchemy_ and Alembic_ which this present effort seeks to
extend.

Zeconomy_ enabled the writing of this library and is one of its first adopters.

Thanks also to ionelmc_, who wrote a template_ that vastly sped up the initial
development process.
